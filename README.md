Tabula Recta
============

This script generates a square table of ASCII characters.

The idea is to then use this table to 'generate' secure passwords.

I wrote this after reading this [article](http://lifehacker.com/5715794/how-to-write-down-and-encrypt-your-passwords-with-an-old-school-tabula-recta).

I do not use this technique myself nor can I make any guarantees of how secure this method is.

If you do want to use the generated table, change the seed value before generating.
